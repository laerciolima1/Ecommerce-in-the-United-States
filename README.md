## E-commerce in the US in 2020 - A Machine Learning Approach
This project analyzes the E-commerce segment in the United States in 2020, which has experienced significant growth due to the restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this assessment, I explore a dataset from this period and apply machine learning algorithms to predict a dependent variable - profit.

### Project Structure
The project was structured in accordance with the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) and can be divided into the following phases:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

### 1. Business Understanding
In this phase, I researched what E-commerce consists of and the growth of this business model in the United States in 2020. I identified that the prediction of profit from e-commerce sales was a relevant business question.

### 2. Data Understanding
In this phase, I explored and characterized our dataset. I identified the type of variables, number of columns, rows, and missing values. I produced graphs from the variables to better understand the data. I was also able to find out the categories of the best-selling products during 2020, the period to which our dataset belongs, and which US state has more E-commerce transactions.

### 3. Data Preparation
In this phase, I prepared the final data set for modeling. I performed data cleaning, dropped non-needed features, and analyzed outliers.

### 4. Modeling
In this phase, I determined which machine learning algorithms to apply to produce the best model. I proposed predicting e-commerce profit, for which I prepared the data for modeling in Python using machine learning techniques. The separation of the machine learning models and their application was crucial to solve the business question.

### 5. Evaluation
In this phase, I evaluated which model best meets the business. I used accuracy as a measure to evaluate the performance of the models. Among the selected models, the Random Forest, using or not the grid search, was the one that obtained the best result, all above 95% of accuracy.

### 6. Deployment
In this phase, I summarized all the characteristics and patterns found during this project. I can assure the executives that the outlook for this sector is promising since an increase in profit is forecast. However, my work does not end here. I must develop a model implementation plan, monitor and maintain the model, and finally provide a final report of findings that will assist in improving the model for final client and end-users.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of data analysis and interpretation of results to choose the best model that meets the business needs. It also highlights the potential of the E-commerce segment in the United States, which has shown significant growth in recent years.
